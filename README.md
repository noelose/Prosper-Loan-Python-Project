## Prosper-Loan-Python-Project

## Introduction
- This is a dataset of Prosper Loan it's a comprehensive collection of information about loans and their associated borrowers. This dataset includes various features such as loan amounts, borrower credit ratings, employment status, and more, providing an excellent opportunity to analyze trends, relationships, and potential predictors of loan performance.



## Interesting Relationships
  
- Credit Score vs Loan Status: There is a noticeable connection between Credit Score and Loan Status. Borrowers with higher credit scores generally have better loan statuses and they are less likely to default. This suggests that individuals with good credit are more likely to be approved for loans and are better at managing their repayments. While, those with lower credit scores tend to default more frequently, which aligns with expectations around creditworthiness and loan risk.

- Loan Amount vs Loan Term: The relationship between Loan Amount and Loan Term is also worth noting. Borrowers who request higher loan amounts tend to choose longer loan terms. This might be because they need more time to repay the larger loan, which makes sense from a financial planning perspective. Shorter loan terms are typically chosen for smaller loans, likely because they are more manageable and borrowers want to pay them off more quickly.


## Conclusion
### Main Findings
- Income and Loan Amount: There is a clear correlation between income and loan amount, with higher income borrowers generally requesting larger loans. Middle income groups, such as 25,000 to $74,999, make up the majority of borrowers.

- Credit Scores Impact on Loans: Borrowers with higher credit scores tend to request and receive larger loan amounts. This is expected as better credit scores signal financial reliability to lenders.

- Homeownership Influence: Homeowners tend to borrow larger amounts compared to renters. This likely reflects the stability associated with homeownership, making these borrowers appear less risky to lenders.

- Borrower APR: Higher APRs were typically associated with borrowers in lower income brackets or those with lower credit scores. This suggests that APRs reflect the perceived risk of the borrower.

- Employment Status: Employed borrowers generally request higher loan amounts compared to those who are unemployed. This shows that employment status plays a role in determining loan amounts, with employed borrowers perceived as more financially stable.




### Steps Taken During Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning: We addressed missing values and renamed unclear columns and standardize it for clarity and consistency.

- Univariate Analysis: We explored individual variables such as income and loan amounts through histograms and boxplots, which revealed trends.

- Bivariate Analysis: We analyzed relationships, like loan amounts vs. income ranges, using visualizations to understand how these variables interact.

- Identifying Key Patterns: We found that higher incomes and better credit scores generally lead to larger loans, shedding light on loan approval factors.
